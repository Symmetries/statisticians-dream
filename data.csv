The cognitive foundation for producing the inventory is represented by the regional inventory of greenhouse gas emissions, created by the Emilia-Romagna Region and ARPA Emilia-Romagna, according to the standard methods of estimation recognised on an international level (IPCC, CORINAIR). To construct this regional inventory, the INEMAR software was used (INventario EMissioni ARia: Air Emissions Inventory), which consists of an application system created to estimate the emissions of various pollutants, for various types of activity (e.g.: heating, traffic, agriculture and industry) and by type of fuel, according to the international classification adopted in the field of EMEP-CORINAIR inventories. As envisaged by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines, in order to calculate emissions, the “bottom‐up” method was used, based on the sector end-use of fuels. In those cases where it was not possible to obtain accurate data, particularly concerning territorial data, a ""top-down"" approach was used, resorting to statistical processing of data aggregated at a provincial level. The overall picture of emissions of the Terre Estensi Association was built from the emissions inventory of the individual Municipalities of Ferrara, Masi Torello and Voghiera that constitute the Association, making the sum of the contributions of the three Municipalities. In line with the agreements within the Regional Work Group on Climate Plans, the year 2007 was chosen as a baseline reference year. The classification of the sources was created in accordance with the Cartesio Guidelines, which correspond with the ICLEI Protocol and ISO 14064."

The inventory methodology involves two sections: a community-wide assessment and a separate inventory of government operations. Once completed, these inventories provide the basis for an emission forecast, and allow for the quantification of emission reductions associated with proposed measures. Baltimore City’s Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory consists of two essentially distinct inventories: one for the Baltimore City community as a whole, defined by geographic borders, and one highlighting emissions resulting from the City of Baltimore’s Government operations and buildings owned. The Government Inventory is a subset of the Community Inventory (emissions from the municipal operations are embedded in the community inventory). Distinguishing the City Governmental emissions in this way allows the City, which formally committed to reducing emissions, to lead by example in tracking its own facilities and vehicles while evaluating the effectiveness of its emission reduction efforts. Compiling Baltimore City’s emissions inventory required the collection of information from a variety of sources. The data represents 2010 energy usage, except where notes indicate data gaps that necessitated use of older records. For our scope, all emissions associated with energy consumed in Baltimore City are included, regardless of the location of the original energy source. This means that, even though the electricity used by Baltimore residents is produced in a plant outside of Baltimore City’s geographical borders, this energy and the emissions associated with it appear in Baltimore City’s inventory. The decision to capture emissions in this way reflects the general philosophy that a community should take full responsibility for the impacts associated with its energy consumption, regardless of where the energy generation occurs."

GHG emissions for electricity consumption - The indirect CO2 emissions per electricity consumption were calculated taking into account the average emission factor of the National Interconnected System in each year of the period considered. GHG emissions per treatment and release of liquid effluents - Belo Horizonte has 4 sewage treatment plants (STP) in operation, which are emitting methane and nitrous oxide.There are a fifth STP that employs physicolchemical processes that do not emit greenhouse gases. A fraction of sewage collected in Belo Horizonte is not forwarded to any treatment plant, being deposited directly into the water body; another fraction of wastewater, which is not collected, it is presumably treated in septic systems (septic tanks), followed by infiltration. GHG emissions by treating municipal solid waste - Landfill - The solids waste generated in Belo Horizonte are taken for disposal in landfill (CTR Macaúbas), where there is no biogas recovery system. It was assumed that 100% of the biogas generated in massive municipal solid waste is released into the atmosphere. A fraction of the waste collected in the city is still willing to massive treatment center CTR-BR-040 in Belo Horizonte, in a separate area where, from 2010, began a system of thermoelectric generation from biogas generated at the landfill. Thus, biogas derived from the ancient massive waste should not be considered in the GHG inventory from 2010. Is it considered only the fraction derived from the provisions in recent separate area and not covered by biogas recovery system. It is worth mentioning that according to this model first-order decay, For purposes of this inventory, we adopted a period of 10 (ten) years as horizon degradation of waste within the massif. Composting - BH also conducts composting for organic waste. These activities take place in the CTRS Rod BR-040 and may incur nitrous oxide and methane."

This information is provided to us in various reporting categories such as residential, commercial and industrial. We are now receiving this information at the finest level of granularity that can be provided from the utilities. Propane fuel use for transportation is taken from Statistics Canada as recorded for the Province of Alberta, and then prorated according to the population of Edmonton compared to the population of Alberta. The diesel and gasoline use in litres is done in a similar fashion, but the information in this case is provided to us from the Alberta provincial government. The natural gas consumption in vehicles is received directly from the natural gas distributor. The conversion factors are derived from various sources: electricity grid intensity comes from Statistics Canada - this factor, is always two years behind the calendar year; natural gas and liquid fuels from US Environmental protection Agency, or Natural Resources Canada references, and the local utilities. The data is input manually each year into an excel spreadsheet model, and the conversion factors are checked for updates each year.

Data used to calculate fugitive and process CH4 and process N2O from wastewater treatment were provided by DEP. CH4 emissions were calculated based on the destruction of volatile material in anaerobic digesters. Based on the measured concentration and flow of volatile organic solids, it is estimated that 15 cubic feet of digester gas is produced for every pound of volatile organic solids destroyed. N2O emissions were calculated by applying the daily nitrogen load discharged by each of the City’s 14 wastewater treatment plant to the formula in the LGOP. Fugitive CH4 from in-city landfills was calculated from landfill gas collection data provided by the New York City Department of Sani- tation (DSNY) and DEP per the LGOP. Fugitive CH4 from exported solid waste was calculated using waste disposal figures for resi- dential, commercial, and construction and demolition waste and applying emissions factors from the USCP, which were taken from EPA’s Waste Reduction Model (WARM). Fugitive CH4 from natural gas distribution was calculated using data provided by National Grid and ConEd. Fugitive SF6 from electricity distribution was cal- culated using data provided by ConEd. ."
